# End-to-End Runtime Prompt Firewall Setup for Azure AI Foundry

## Objective

All user prompts are first checked by AccuKnox LLM Defence using Azure API Management (APIM) before reaching Azure AI Foundry. This setup ensures:

- Clients do not connect directly to Foundry.
- Only the user’s question is sent to AccuKnox for scanning.
- The full request is forwarded to Foundry if approved.
- Requests are blocked if AccuKnox marks them unsafe.
- Foundry only receives allowed requests.
- Secrets are securely managed in APIM.
- Client code changes only the endpoint and API key.

# Azure APIM Automated Deployment with LLM Prompt & Response Firewall

This repository provides a **fully automated Azure API Management (APIM) deployment** that provisions an API and operation on an **existing APIM instance**, applies an **operation-level security policy**, and integrates **AccuKnox LLM Defence** to inspect and block unsafe prompts and model responses **at runtime**.

The solution acts as a **secure proxy** in front of Azure AI Foundry / OpenAI-compatible models with **minimal onboarding effort** and **no manual APIM configuration**.

## ⚙️ Configuration (`.env`)

Create a `.env` file in the repository root.
Each variable must be filled by the user. **Do not commit real values to source control.**

### 📄 `.env` (Single-Line, Commented)

```env
SUBSCRIPTION_ID=        # Azure subscription ID (example: 69e37648-d32f-46a0-a45e-e983eb816225)
RESOURCE_GROUP=         # Existing resource group name (example: ai-runtime-firewall-test)
LOCATION=               # Azure region, wrap in quotes if needed (example: "East US")

APIM_SERVICE_NAME=      # Existing API Management service name (example: prompt-firewall-apim)

API_ID=                 # Unique API identifier, no spaces (example: foundry-proxy-api)
API_DISPLAY_NAME=       # Display name shown in APIM, use quotes (example: "Foundry Proxy API")
API_PATH=               # Public base path for the API (example: foundry)


OPERATION_ID=           # Unique operation identifier (example: chat-completions)
OPERATION_DISPLAY_NAME= # Operation display name, use quotes (example: "Chat Completions")
OPERATION_METHOD=       # HTTP method for the operation (example: POST)
OPERATION_URL_TEMPLATE= # Operation URL template (example: /models/chat/completions)
```

Perfect — below is the **updated README section** with **exact line numbers called out**, so users know **precisely where to edit** in `policy.xml`.
This is written in a **copy-paste ready, customer-safe format**.

You can drop this section directly into your existing `README.md`.

---

## ⚠️ Mandatory Policy Changes (User Action Required)

Before running the deployment, you **must update two values** in the following file:

```
policies/policy.xml
```

These values are **environment- and deployment-specific** and **must be updated manually**.

---

## 🔁 Change 1: AccuKnox LLM Defence Endpoint

### 📍 Lines to Update

- **Line ~45** – Prompt scan (Inbound)
- **Line ~135** – Response scan (Outbound)

> ⚠️ You must update **both occurrences**

---

### 🔴 Default Value (As Shipped)

```xml
<set-url>https://cwpp.dev.accuknox.com/llm-defence/application-query</set-url>
```

---

### ✅ Required Change

Replace the URL with your **AccuKnox environment-specific endpoint**:

```text
https://cwpp.<your-environment>.accuknox.com/llm-defence/application-query
```

---

### 📌 Environment Examples

| Environment | URL                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Development | `https://cwpp.dev.accuknox.com/llm-defence/application-query`   |
| Staging     | `https://cwpp.stage.accuknox.com/llm-defence/application-query` |
| Production  | `https://cwpp.prod.accuknox.com/llm-defence/application-query`  |

---

## 🔁 Change 2: Azure AI Foundry Backend URL

### 📍 Line to Update

- **Line ~100** – Backend forwarding configuration

---

### 🔴 Default Value (As Shipped)

```xml
<set-backend-service base-url="https://ai-prompt-firewall-openai.services.ai.azure.com" />
```

---

### ✅ Required Change

Replace the `base-url` with **your Azure AI Foundry / OpenAI deployment endpoint**:

```xml
<set-backend-service base-url="https://<your-foundry-resource>.services.ai.azure.com" />
```

---

### 📌 Example

```xml
<set-backend-service base-url="https://my-foundry-openai.services.ai.azure.com" />
```

> ⚠️ This URL **must exactly match** the endpoint of your deployed model and must support **Bearer token authentication**.

---

## ✅ Summary of Required Policy Edits

| Change              | File         | Line(s)   | Description                        |
| ------------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| AccuKnox endpoint   | `policy.xml` | ~45, ~135 | Set correct AccuKnox environment   |
| Foundry backend URL | `policy.xml` | ~100      | Set your model deployment endpoint |

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Line numbers may vary slightly if comments are added or removed
- Always verify both **prompt** and **response** scan URLs
- Deployment will **fail or block traffic** if these values are incorrect

---

## 🔐 Secrets Handling (Mandatory)

Secrets **must not** be placed in `.env`.

This deployment requires the following **APIM Named Value**:

| Name                | Purpose                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `LLM_DEFENCE_TOKEN` | AccuKnox LLM Defence API token |

Create it securely using:

```bash
bash named-values/named-values.sh <RESOURCE_GROUP> <APIM_SERVICE_NAME>
```

The script prompts for the token securely (input hidden).

---

## 🚀 Deployment

Make the deployment script executable:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
```

Run the deployment:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This will:

- Set the Azure subscription
- Deploy the API and operation via Bicep
- Apply the operation-level policy
- Bind the backend service
- Enable prompt and response scanning

## 🧠 Policy Behavior Summary

### Inbound Processing

- Extracts and validates `Authorization: Bearer` token
- Extracts `messages[0].content` from request body
- Calls AccuKnox LLM Defence (prompt scan)
- Blocks unsafe prompts (`403 Forbidden`)
- Forwards safe requests to Azure AI Foundry

### Outbound Processing

- Extracts model response content
- Calls AccuKnox LLM Defence (response scan)
- Blocks unsafe responses before returning to client
