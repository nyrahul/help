# SARIF Findings

SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) is a standard format for the output of static analysis tools. AccuKnox supports importing findings in the SARIF format, allowing you to consolidate security results from various tools into a single platform.

By integrating SARIF findings, you can visualize and manage security issues identified by third-party scanners alongside AccuKnox's native findings. This integration is typically set up using a workflow to ingest the SARIF files.

AccuKnox supports importing SARIF findings from any tool that exports in this standard format. Some common platforms that export SARIF include:

- **Sonatype**
- **Jfrog**
- **Gitleaks**
- **Checkmarx**
- **Any Tool that Export SARIF**

We can import these findings and display them within the AccuKnox platform, providing a unified view of your security posture.
