# Onboarding AWS Organization Accounts to AccuKnox

Managing security across multiple AWS accounts is complex. **AWS Organizations** simplifies this by grouping accounts under one structure. **AccuKnox** enhances this by enabling organization-level onboarding—removing the need to add accounts individually. This ensures centralized visibility, consistent policy enforcement, and automatic coverage for new accounts.

This guide explains how to onboard your **AWS Organization root account** to AccuKnox.

## Prerequisites

- You must have administrative access to your AWS Management Account and have permissions to deploy CloudFormation StackSet across the Organization.
- You need the AWS Organization ID of your root organization.
- **Enable all features in AWS Organizations**:
  You must enable all features in your AWS Organization. If only consolidated billing is enabled, you won’t be able to create StackSets with service-managed permissions.[Ref: Enable All Features – AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html)
- **Trusted Access must be activated for AWS CloudFormation StackSets ([ref link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-activate-trusted-access.html))**:
    - Sign in as an administrator to the AWS Management Account.
    - Open the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).
    - From the navigation pane, choose **StackSets**.
    - If trusted access is not enabled, a banner will appear — click **Activate trusted access**.

## Post-Onboarding

Once your AWS Organization is successfully onboarded:

- **Asset Discovery:**
  AccuKnox will start an inventory discovery process across all member accounts in the selected regions.

- **Security Scans:**
  Automated security scans will be scheduled to assess your cloud resources for misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and compliance violations.

- **Dashboard Population:**
  Data will begin to populate your AccuKnox dashboards, providing insights into your organization's security posture.
  This may take some time depending on the size and complexity of your AWS environment.

You have now successfully onboarded your **AWS Organization** to **AccuKnox**, enabling comprehensive, centralized cloud security management.
