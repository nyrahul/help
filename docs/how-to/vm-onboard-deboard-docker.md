# Onboarding and Deboarding VMs with Docker

## **Docker**

Docker v19.0.3 and Docker Compose v1.27.0+ are required. Follow the latest [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ "https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/") for downloading. Ensure you also add your user to the docker user group: [Linux post-installation steps for Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/ "https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/").

Linux Kernel v5.8+ with BPF LSM support is needed. See how to [enable BPF LSM](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/blob/main/getting-started/FAQ.md#checking-and-enabling-support-for-bpf-lsm "https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/blob/main/getting-started/FAQ.md#checking-and-enabling-support-for-bpf-lsm").

If the environment does not support Linux v5.8+ or BPF LSM and instead uses AppArmor, host enforcement will still work out of the box. However, to protect containers, new containers must be created with special options. Refer to the "[Support for Non-Orchestrated Containers](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/wiki/Support-for-non-orchestrated-containers "https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/wiki/Support-for-non-orchestrated-containers")" documentation for more details.

### Resource Requirements

| Node Type          | vCPU  | Memory  | Disk   |
|--------------------|-------|---------|--------|
| Control Plane Node | 2     | 4 GB    | 24 GB  |
| Worker Node        | 100m  | 200 MB  | ~500 MB|

### Network Requirements

Connectivity between control plane node and worker nodes is a must. They should either be:

- Part of the same private network **(recommended & secure)**

- Control plane has a public IP (not recommended)

Ports required on the control plane VM:


| Component                       | Type                           | Ports          | Endpoint                          | Purpose                                           |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Knox-Gateway                    | Outbound to SaaS               | 3000           | `knox-gw.<env>.accuknox.com:3000`  | For Knox-Gateway service                         |
| PPS                             | Outbound to SaaS               | 443            | `pps.<env>.accuknox.com`           | For PPS (Policy Provisioning Service)            |
| Spire-Server                    | Outbound to SaaS               | 8081, 9090     | `spire.<env>.accuknox.com`         | For Spire-Server communication                   |
| KubeArmor Relay Server          | Inbound in Control Plane       | 32768          | -                                | For KubeArmor relay server on control plane      |
| Shared Informer Agent           | Inbound in Control Plane       | 32769          | -                                | For Shared Informer agent on control plane       |
| Policy Enforcement Agent (PEA)  | Inbound in Control Plane       | 32770          | -                                | For Policy Enforcement Agent on control plane    |
| Hardening Module                | Inbound in Control Plane       | 32771          | -                                | For Discovery Engine Hardening Module            |
| VM Worker Nodes                 | Outbound from worker node to Control Plane | 32768-32771   | -                                | For VM worker nodes to connect to the control plane |


By default, the network created by onboarding commands reserves the subnet `172.20.32.0/27`. If you want to change it for your environment, you can use the `--network-cidr` flag.

You can check the connectivity between nodes using curl. Upon a successful connection, the message returned by curl will be:

```
$ curl <control-plane-addr>:32770
curl: (1) Received HTTP/0.9 when not allowed
```

## Onboarding

Navigate to the onboarding page (Settings → Manage Cluster → Onboard Now) and choose the "VM" option on the instructions page. Then, provide a name for your cluster. You will be presented with instructions to download accuknox-cli and onboard your cluster.

The following agents are installed:

1. **Feeder-service** which collects KubeArmor feeds.

2. **Shared-informer-agent** authenticates with your VMs and collects information regarding entities like hosts, containers, and namespaces.

3. **Policy-enforcement-agent** authenticates with your VMs and enforces labels and policies.

### Install knoxctl/accuknox-cli

`curl -sfL https://knoxctl.accuknox.com/install.sh | sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/bin`

### Onboarding Control Plane

The command may look something like this:

```sh
$ knoxctl onboard vm cp-node \
--version v0.10.7 \
--join-token=ae0e9974-6a8d-4c4f-9148-fb4e0ca769d9 \ #this may vary
--spire-host=spire.accuknox.com \
--pps-host=pps.accuknox.com \
--knox-gateway=knox-gw.accuknox.com:3000 \
--vm-mode="systemd" \  # this may vary
--enable-host-policy-discovery \
--hostViz="process,network,file,capabilities" \
--viz="process,network,file"
```

The above command will emit the command to onboard worker nodes. You may also use the `--Control Plane-node-addr` flag to specify the address that other nodes will use to connect with your cluster.

By default, the network created by onboarding commands reserves the subnet `172.20.32.0/27` for the `accuknox-net` Docker network. If you want to change it for your environment, you can use the `--network-cidr` flag.

As for the additional flags, here is the parameter table:

| Flag | Scope | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--enable-host-policy-discovery` | Host | --- | Enables automatic host-level policy discovery (process, network, file, capabilities). |
| `--hostViz=<options>` | Host-level telemetry visualization | `process,network,file,capabilities` | Visualizes **process activity**, **network traffic**, **file access**, and **Linux capabilities**. |
| `--viz=<options>` | Containers, workloads, or VM-level view | `process,network,file` | Visualizes **process**, **network**, and **file** activities. |


### Onboarding Worker Nodes

The second command will be for onboarding worker nodes. It may look something like this:

`knoxctl onboard vm node --Control Plane-node-addr=<control-plane-addr>`

Example:

```sh
$ knoxctl onboard vm node --Control Plane-node-addr=192.168.56.106
Pulling kubearmor-init       ... done
Pulling kubearmor            ... done
Pulling kubearmor-vm-adapter ... done
Creating network "accuknox-config_accuknox-net" with the default driver
Creating kubearmor-init ... done
Creating kubearmor      ... done
Creating kubearmor-vm-adapter ... done
onboard-vm-node.go:41: VM successfully joined with control-plane!
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while onboarding, use the commands below to debug:

```sh
docker logs spire-agent -f
docker logs shared-informer-agent -f
docker logs kubearmor-init -f
docker logs kubearmor -f
```

## Deboarding

Deboard the cluster from SaaS first.

To deboard the worker-vm/Node:

`knoxctl deboard vm node`

To deboard the Control-Plane VM:

`knoxctl deboard vm Control Plane-node`

Sample Output:

```sh
$ knoxctl deboard vm Control Plane-node

After that cleanup the ~/.accuknox-config directory

`sudo rm -rf ~/.accuknox-config`
