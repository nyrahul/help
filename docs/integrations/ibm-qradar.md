# IBM QRadar Integration

## Integration Architecture

The integration flow enables alert forwarding from AccuKnox to IBM QRadar. Alerts generated in the AccuKnox UI, sourced from findings and various alert sources, are processed by a rules engine and triggers according to the configured settings. These alerts are then transported via a webhook server set up in the customer environment, using the Syslog protocol to forward them to IBM QRadar, which serves as the final destination for receiving the alerts.

### Architecture Components

1. AccuKnox platform (source)
2. Webhook server (intermediary)
3. Syslog protocol (transport)
4. IBM QRadar (destination)

### Customer Integration Process

- Configure webhook in AccuKnox (See [**Webhook Integration Guide**](https://help.accuknox.com/integrations/webhook-integration/)).
- Set up QRadar configuration (customer responsibility).
- Report configuration completion back to AccuKnox.
