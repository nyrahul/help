    - [Agent-based Windows VM Scanning](https://help.accuknox.com/how-to/vm-security/agent-based/windows/)

A lightweight Omni agent runs on the VM and performs scheduled scans. Results are sent to the AccuKnox SaaS for centralized visibility.

- **Linux**: Uses a systemd service and timer.
- **Windows**: Uses a scheduled task.
- **Malware Scanning**: Optional and disabled by default due to CPU cost. Resource usage can be capped.
- **Air-gapped Environments**: Supported by pre-downloading binaries and vulnerability databases and installing without outbound internet access.
